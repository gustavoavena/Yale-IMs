# Yale-IMs
A website to manage the Yale Intramurals.
This was my CS50 Final Project together with Gabriel Simoes.
When we were implementing the website, we used CS50 IDE hosted on Cloud9 and its resources, like its own versions of apache and mySQL. We will finish the implementation of this website and put it online using heroku in the coming month.
